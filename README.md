# Bitaxe Hashrate Benchmark

A Python-based benchmarking tool for optimizing Bitaxe mining performance by testing different voltage and frequency combinations while monitoring hashrate, temperature, and power efficiency.

## Features

- Automated benchmarking of different voltage/frequency combinations
- Temperature monitoring and safety cutoffs
- Power efficiency calculations (J/TH)
- Automatic saving of benchmark results
- Graceful shutdown with best settings retention
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Access to a Bitaxe miner on your network
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrv777/Bitaxe-Hashrate-Benchmark.git
cd Bitaxe-Hashrate-Benchmark
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker Installation

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t bitaxe-benchmark .
```

## Usage

### Standard Usage

Run the benchmark tool by providing your Bitaxe's IP address:

```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py <bitaxe_ip>
```

Optional parameters:
- `-v, --voltage`: Initial voltage in mV (default: 1150)
- `-f, --frequency`: Initial frequency in MHz (default: 500)

Example:
```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py 192.168.2.26 -v 1200 -f 550
```

### Docker Usage

Run the container with your Bitaxe's IP address:

```bash
docker run --rm bitaxe-benchmark <bitaxe_ip> [options]
```

Example:
```bash
docker run --rm bitaxe-benchmark 192.168.2.26 -v 1200 -f 550
```

## Configuration

The script includes several configurable parameters:

- Maximum temperature: 66Â°C
- Maximum allowed voltage: 1400mV
- Maximum allowed frequency: 1200MHz
- Benchmark duration: 20 minutes
- Sample interval: 30 seconds

## Output

The benchmark results are saved to `bitaxe_benchmark_results.json`, containing:
- Average hashrate
- Temperature readings
- Power efficiency metrics
- Voltage/frequency combinations tested

## Safety Features

- Automatic temperature monitoring with safety cutoff
- Graceful shutdown on interruption (Ctrl+C)
- Automatic reset to best performing settings after benchmarking
- Input validation for safe voltage and frequency ranges
